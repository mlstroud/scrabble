## Specs
| Behavior                                                 | Input             | Output           |
|:---------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|-----------------:|
| The program will accept a word from user.                | "Hello"           | N/A              |
| The program will convert the word to lower case.         | "Hello"           | "hello"          |
| The program will get the score of the first letter.      | "Hello"           | 4                |
| The program will add the score to the total score.       | "Hello"           | 0 + 4 = 4        |
| The program will do nothing if not a valid letter.       | "@#!"             | 0                |
| The program will repeat for every letter in the word.    | "Hello"           | 4+1+1+1+1= 8     |
